            Born in Venice and now based in Stuttgart, Emanuele crafts frames,
            mirrors, and sculptural wood objects entirely by hand. Each creation
            follows the natural flow of the wood, celebrating movement, texture,
            and light.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a sharp eye for detail and a deep respect for traditional
            craftsmanship, Emanuele brings custom commissions to life â€” from
            intricate carvings to bespoke frames and unique wooden objects.
